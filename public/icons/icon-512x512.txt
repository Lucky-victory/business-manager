This file is a placeholder for the icon-512x512.png that should be created for the PWA.

In a production environment, you should replace this with an actual PNG image that:
1. Has dimensions of 512x512 pixels
2. Uses the brand color (#4f46e5) as the background
3. Contains the "BM" text or Biz Manager logo in white
4. Is properly optimized for web use
5. Has the "purpose": "any maskable" attribute in the manifest.json

This icon is used for:
- High-resolution app icon on Android devices
- Splash screens on some devices
- The largest icon in the PWA manifest
- Apple touch icon for iPad Pro and other large iOS devices
