This file is a placeholder for the offline-image.png that should be created for the PWA.

In a production environment, you should replace this with an actual PNG image that:
1. Has dimensions of at least 512x512 pixels
2. Uses the brand color (#4f46e5) as the background
3. Contains a simple icon or text indicating that the content is unavailable offline
4. Is properly optimized for web use

The offline-image.png is used by the service worker when image requests fail in offline mode.
